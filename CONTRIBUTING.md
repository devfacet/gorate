# Contributing

- Code contributions must be through pull requests
- Run tests, linting and formatting before a pull request
- Pull requests can not be merged without being reviewed
- Use "Issues" for bug reports, feature requests and discussions
- Do not refactor existing code without a discussion
- Do not add a new third party dependency without a discussion
- Use semantic versioning and git tags for versioning
